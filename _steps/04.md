name: Step 4 - Make your data accessible
---
We are hoping to make known in the community the existence Newport Data Project and its mission to provide the public with a central hub to find non-governmental information about our community. The benefit of having a central hub where all of this information can be found, versus disparate websites of various organizations, is that it provides a higher level of accessibility and visibility as well as the opportunity to make connections across datasets. One go-to resource helps build a culture in our community that values and uses open data. By adding your data to the public repository at the Newport Data Project, the community is more likely to be made aware of it and make use of it. You send your data file to the Newport Data Project, and we do the work to make it available for download by the public.
